                  <h2>Location</h2>
         <p align="justify">The high energy theory group is headquarted on the third floor of the Ernest Rutherford Physics Building, located at 3600 rue University (see <a href="https://maps.mcgill.ca/?cmp=1&txt=EN&id=Rutherford" target="_blank">here</a> for a map). The easiest way to access the building is from rue University; the building is located at the intersection of rue Prince-Arthur and rue University.</p>
        <h2>Directions from the hotels to the Rutherford Physics Building:</h2>
        <p align="justify">You can find a map leading you from the hotels to the Rutherford Physics Building in the McGill campus here: <a href= "Map_hotel.PDF ">map </a></p>
        <h2>Getting to Montreal and Around:</h2>
        <p align="justify" class="body">Montreal's airport is Pierre-Trudeau, also known as Dorval (code<strong> YUL</strong>). The easiest way to get to and from the airport is to take a taxi; the rates from the airport to any location downtown are fixed at $40 CAD (plus tip), and it is approximately a 20-40 min ride (depending on traffic). For your trip back to the airport, taxi stands are available around most major hotels downtown. It is also very convenient to take the No. 747 airport bus which costs for $9, enables passengers to go between YUL and downtown Montreal. This is also included in a 3-day pass on the public-transit system.</p>

You can also buy 1-day and 3-day passes. See the <a href="http://www.stm.info/English/a-somm.htm">website</a> for the latest rates and maps. Metro tickets also work on the local buses; be sure to keep your ticket at all time, it will serve as a correspondence for any other transport on the island for one hour. </p>
